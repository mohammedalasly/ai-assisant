Ovarian Rejuvenation Therapy

What is Ovarian Rejuvenation Therapy?
Ovarian Rejuvenation Therapy represents the latest advancement in reproductive science. It
is an innovative method that aims to balance FSH, E2, AMH, LH levels, impacting the
reconstitution of the menstrual cycle, even after it has stopped.

Types of Ovarian Rejuvenation Therapy
1.Ovarian Rejuvenation with PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma)
-Description: A nonsurgical, transvaginal ultrasound-guided injection, less invasive, with a
shorter and more comfortable recovery.

-Providers: Dr. Koufomichail, Dr. Garavelas, Dr. Fraidakis-Crete Fertility Centre, Dr.
Papanikolaou, Dr. Grigorakis.

2.Laparoscopic PRP
-Best Recommended For: Atrophic ovaries (early menopause), out-of-position ovaries (e.g.,
due to endometriosis).
-Advantages: Allows PRP to accurately reach the ovarian circulation.

3.EnPLAF by Dr. Papanikolaou
-Description: Similar to PRP but uses highly enriched, platelet-free autologous growth
factors.
-Advantages: Growth factors concentration 10-15 times higher than PRP, can be
refrigerated or frozen for future use.

4.EnPRP by Crete Fertility Centre- Description: Direct injection of proteins and growth factors into the ovaries after special
treatment of platelets.
-Advantages: Higher concentration of growth factors.

5.Ovarian Rejuvenation Fortasc by Dr. Garavelas
-Description: Combination of PRP FORTE II 4th generation and Granulocyte Colony-
Stimulating Factor (G-CSF).
-Advantages: Increases reproductive potentiality in poor responders.

6.Laparoscopic Fortasc by Dr. Garavelas
-Description: Similar to Laparoscopic PRP but uses a combination of techniques for more
effective delivery.

7.Renovo 2 by Dr. Garavelas
-Description: Based on regenerative medicine principles to restore the biological
environment.
- Advantages: Outpatient treatment, brief observation period.

8.Stem Cell Ovarian Rejuvenation by Dr. Garavelas
-Description: Uses autologous adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for treating premature
menopause.
-Indications: Infertility, amenorrhea, osteoporosis, depression, heart disease.

9.Transvaginal PRP Ovarian Rejuvenation by Dr. Grigorakis
-Description: Utilizes active plasma rich in growth factors for rejuvenation.
-Advantages: Good results in ovarian rejuvenation.How to Choose the Right Type of Ovarian Rejuvenation Therapy?

can evaluate your specific condition and recommend the most suitable type of therapy
based on your medical history, current health status, and reproductive goals.




Ovarian Rejuvenation
What is Ovarian Rejuvenation?
Ovarian Rejuvenation is a newly pioneered, innovative therapeutic method aiming to balance
hormonal levels (FSH, E2, AMH, LH), impacting the menstrual cycle's reconstitution, and
potentially reversing early menopause to enhance fertility.

Why Consider Ovarian Rejuvenation in Greece?
Greece offers high-quality care, experienced specialists, and affordable treatment options for
Ovarian Rejuvenation Therapy, making it an attractive destination for patients seeking this
innovative treatment.

Are There Any Side Effects?
The risks are minimal and similar to those of an egg retrieval procedure in IVF, including pain,
fever, and some internal bleeding, which typically diminish after administering oral pain
medication.

How is Ovarian Rejuvenation Therapy Performed?
The therapy involves a two-hour procedure divided into two phases: preparation of the
patient’s PRP and injection of PRP into the ovaries using a non-surgical, transvaginal
ultrasound-guided injection under sedation.Is One Round of Treatment Sufficient?
While one round of treatment has shown benefits and results can appear between 2 to 24
weeks, the effects vary per individual, with some experiencing therapeutic effects lasting 5 to
7 months.

What Follow-Up Procedures Are Recommended for International Patients?
Patients coming from abroad are advised on follow-up care, including weekly monitoring for a
month through blood tests and vaginal ultrasounds in their home country.

Who Benefits Most from Ovarian Rejuvenation Therapy?
Ideal candidates include women under 40 with Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI), early
peri-menopause, low ovarian reserve, or low AMH levels, and menopausal or perimenopausal
women under 50.




Safety Concerns with Ovarian Rejuvenation
The treatment is deemed safe, utilizing the patient's own blood, thereby minimizing the risk of
virus transmission or allergic reactions.

Cost of Ovarian Rejuvenation Treatment in Greece
Costs start from 1700€ at Crete Fertility Centre to 1950€ and above, depending on the clinic
and specific procedure, with Greece offering more affordable options compared to the UK or
America.Stem Cell Ovarian Rejuvenation

Introduction to Stem Cell Ovarian Rejuvenation
Stem Cell Ovarian Rejuvenation is a groundbreaking treatment aimed at combating
premature menopause through the use of autologous adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs).
This innovative technique is exclusively performed by the Garavelas Medical Group.

What is Stem Cell Ovarian Rejuvenation?
It's a treatment targeting premature menopause, utilizing ADSCs extracted from the patient's
own adipose (fat) tissue. It's particularly indicated for infertility and interruption of the
menstrual cycle, addressing ovary dysfunction linked to various intra and extra-ovarian
factors.

How Does it Work?
The process involves:
1.Collection of SVF and Blood: A small portion of fat tissue and a few ml of blood are
collected.

2.Processing: Mechanical dissociation of SVF, followed by centrifugation, and isolation of
ADSCs from the SVF.
3.Renovo2 Production: Involves a two-step centrifugation, discarding excess plasma, and
concentrating growth factors.

4.Combination for Administration: The two components are combined, forming a product
rich in regenerative growth factors, such as TGF-β1, FGF, PDGF, VEGF, EGF, and HGF, aimed at
rejuvenating the ovaries through specific signaling pathways.

Who is a Good Candidate?
Ideal candidates include those experiencing:
-Infertility
-Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation)
-Osteoporosis (especially due to early menopause)
-Depression or anxiety linked to reduced estrogen levels
-Heart disease risk due to early loss of estrogen

Results of the Treatment
Patients can expect:
-Reduced FSH levels
-Increased E2 levels
-Improved ovary weight
-Restoration of ovary function
-Stimulation of follicle formation
-Resumption of menstruation
-Stable and safe results


Cost of the Treatment
The cost of the procedure is 4,950.00 €, which includes the fee for the anesthetist.
